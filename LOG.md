06/06/2017
----------
> Meeting with Prof. Guido Bugmann, resultant course of action:
> Possible approaches include:
> * Machine Learning.
> * Convolutional Neural Network.
> * Machine Learning with Template Matching.
> Talk to Dr. Phil Culverhouse about his Plankton detection/classification. 

15/06/2017
----------
> Understood the maing principles of Convolutional Neural Networks.

> Develop a theoretical framework for using a CNN for Malaria detection. 


16/06/20187
-----------
> Setup automatic backup system with versioning and synced laptop and desktop. 

> Install TensorFlow and Keras.

> Install OpenCV.

17/06/2017
----------
> Read Prof. Dik Morling's papers on Malaria Detection.

> Read about MalaDiag.

19/06/2017
----------
> Confirmed how data for each sample will be stored.
> * Each sample will have Image objects.
> * Each Image object will have rbc and wbc objects.

> Decided to use a pandas dataframe to store all results.

> Completed a method to let the user classify each cell manually for training.

> Completed a method to initialise the sample objects from a test.info file.
> * Each cell imaged saved for training will be labled with the sample id, image id and cell id.
> * This way, a CNN can be trained for a given set of samples.
